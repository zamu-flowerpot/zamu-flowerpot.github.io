# Introduction

Simple website for recommending Harry Potter fanfiction.

Built using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

## Recommendations

### Community Recs

Community Recs are fics I've prompted the community input from (or have wholesale copied recommendations lists from the community), so they might appeal more broadly.

> These tend to follow the pattern of `Longer`, `Shorter`, `One-shots`, and `Ongoing`. With:
> - `Longer` being greater than 80k words
> - `Shorter` being greater than 4k words but less than 80k words
> - `One-shots` being less than 4k words
> - `Ongoing` being fics that are not finished

### Personal Recs

Personal Recs are fics I've chosen and thus are all over the place in terms of "quality" and might not suit your tastes.

- [milfoy](./recommendations/milfoy.md) - Narcissa Black Malfoy/Harry Potter

### Work in Progress Recs

Either I haven't started, or I need more fics before feeling confident in the recommendations.
