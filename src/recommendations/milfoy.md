Harry Potter/Narcissa Black Malfoy

> NB: For the most part, these aren't shlocky "Draco did/said something bad post-war and now Narcissa will do *anything* to save him from Azkaban" fics. If they are, I'll mention why they are included.
>
> Oh, other than having ongoing fics at the top of each section, there is no particular ordering.

## Less Smut

**"Wow! A Milfoy Story that isn't primarily focused on smut!"**

Sadly, just entering this category means that the story is probably a cut above the rest of Milfoy fics. Shocking I know, not focusing on smut making the story better. That said, these still might have smut.

- [The gift of time and patience - Mei (Ima1)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30425877)
    - `21k words`, `2 chapters`, `slow burn`, `post war` 
    - nice and slow build up that just makes the relationship work so well
    - leaves off on a high note
- [Starry nights and sunny skies - Mei (Ima1)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/25129696)
    - `50k words`, `10 chapters`, `time travel`, `post war`
    - time travel fic with Harry travelling and dealing with the first war
    - Novikov self-consistency principle is strong with this one as it tries to keep itself consistent even if it ends up kinda weird
- [Laughing All The Way To London - AppoApples](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31505039)
    - `120k words`, `30 chapters`, `time travel`, `pre first war`, `teacher Harry`
    - time travel, dad!Harry, teacher!Harry? I'm game
    - the issue I have with this fic is that Narcissa is essentially an OC slotted into Narcissa Black's place, it works but it's not Narcissa Malfoy, ya know?
- [Whispers of a Raven - TheBlack'sResurgence](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13864586/1/Whispers-of-a-Raven)
    - `347k words`, `35 chapters`, `time travel`, `pre first war`, `TBR`
    - TBR can be contentious, but personally I'm a fan of a more nuanced Black family so I generally enjoy his stuff
    - The story can feel a bit chuuni at times, but it doesn't fall into crack or shlock
    - same type of deal as Laughing All the Way to London, OC!Narcissa due to time travel which can be hit or miss. So if you want Narcissa Malfoy™, you might not enjoy it

## Some Smut

**"It's ***MILF***oy after all"**

Decent Milfoy stories that might contain some focus on smut. These aren't any worse than the ones above, just that they might delve into smut longer.

- [The Volunteer - mrs.milfoy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8621542/1/The-Volunteer)
    - `26k words`, `6 chapters`, `post war`
    - Volunteering at the St. Mungo's leads to some interesting happenings in Harry's life
    - You can see the scenes play out and the detente between Harry and Narcissa is wonderful
    - IIRC, my first milfoy fic which opened the flood doors to the rest so kudos on that
- [Scorched Earth Survivor - gevaisa](https://archiveofourown.org/works/35096245)
    - `1k word`, `one-shot`, `post war`, `Narcissa PoV`
    - Narcissa is thrust onto Harry to deal with in the aftermath of the war
    - short snappy and evocative; it'll make you wish this was longer and more fleshed out
- [Ladies and Gentlemen - mrs.milfoy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766122/1/Ladies-and-Gentlemen)
    - `4k word`, `one-shot`, `post war`
    - Harry finds someone breaking the rules and it goes from there
    - not much opinion here other than it's well written and executed
- [The Favour - mrs.milfoy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10503844/1/The-Favour)
    - `15k words`, `2 chapters`, `post war`, `draco malfoy`
    - Draco asks Harry to do him a favor so he can boing his fiancé, Draco gets more than he bargained for
    - not much opinion here other than it's well written and executed


## Milfoy Adjacent

These are stories that aren't primarily focused on Milfoy but she plays a strong role within it.

- [Harry Slays Voldemort - StevenTLawson](https://archiveofourown.org/works/21677116)
    - `5k words/chap`, `ongoing`, `life debt`, "`harem`", 
    - Harry kills Voldemort and earns a life debt
    - life debts results with Harry getting a girlfriend
    - puts a spin on the shlocky milfoy trope leaving Harry with a "harem"
    - it's an interesting premise and I'm intersted to see how this premise would pan out
    - Milfoy is part of the harem, but, with what is out so far, it shouldn't be called a Milfoy fic
- [Hermione deals with this - Chubster23](https://archiveofourown.org/works/39598377)
    - `4k words`, `one-shot`, `post war`, `haphne`, `harry/astoria`, `offscreen smut`
    - written as a homage of sorts to tie together a number of MayorHagger's works into a single story
    - "[an] intersection of plots into a cohesive smutty harem romp [is fire]" - me
    - the worst part of this is that it's so short, the story itself seems like something that *could* occur in a "Harry ended up with a Slytherin" AU
    - the milfoy aspect of this story is essentially [Excuses and Distractions](https://archiveofourown.org/works/22336837) and [Fast Times at Malfoy Manor](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20206903) but I think that the framing that this story builds makes the narrative more compelling
    

## Prompts, Premises, and Other Ideas (for Milfoy)

Maybe you want to take a crack at writing something. Maybe you just need some inspiration. Here are some ideas.

- [Was it all Real or Just a Dream?](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32848348/chapters/81512050)
    - `5k words/chap`, `abandoned?`, `flowerpot`, `older!Harry`
    - this premise is fire and I'm actually upset no one has taken it and used it
    - it's perfect for any cross-generational pairing because this ages Harry up while the rest of the cast stays the same making tricky age shifting easy
    - it isn't explicitly Milfoy, it can work for any pairing with an age gap
    - read it, it's only 5k words and I don't want to detract from the premise by explaining it
- [The Time Harry Stole Lucius's Wife - redowlf96](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13392602/1/The-Time-Harry-Stole-Lucius-s-Wife)
    - `6.2k words/chap`, `abandoned?`, `whiskey wedding challenge`
    - sometimes it's not about the story, but the premise
    - the title makes you think netorare and smut, but it's actually more of a whiskey wedding challenge that someone accepted and tried to make it work with Narcissa
    - the story starts at a pretty high point for suspension of disbelief and only goes up
    - at least the title is fun
    

## All Smut

>I am including these because they are stories that have Harry/Narcissa, are longer than 80k words, and Narcissa isn't an also-ran or harem member in terms of her relationship to Harry.
>
>This isn't to say that these aren't good, but smut is a *heavy* focus. Possibly to the detriment of the narrative.

- [Two Minds, One Wand - RobWilsonWriting](https://archiveofourown.org/works/40318890)
    - `4.5k words/chap`, `ongoing`, `smut`, `amoral OOC Harry`, `bonding`
    - Harry gets the memories of Voldemort after the graveyard and decides to use his acquired knowledge to improve his chances at defeating him using said knowledge
    - lots of fridge logic here so the story might be a heavy miss for some with the "bonding"
    - smut gets in the way at times of an interesting premise and moral dilemma
    - I'd totally read this even if the smut faded to black
    - probably the one with the most plot out of the PWP fics
- [Whore Class - Riotstarter1214](https://archiveofourown.org/works/42141555)
    - `24k words/chap`, `ongoing`, `smut`
    - there is no story here, there is only smut
    - probably not your cup of tea unless you are looking for smut with a hint of milfoy
    - there is actually a bit of a relationship between Harry and Narcissa in this work and it could be so much more, but...
    - Harry fucks nearly every female in the setting that could be construed as attarctive
- [A Vow of Control - MayorHagger](https://archiveofourown.org/works/22488859)
    - `12k words/chap`, `ongoing`, `smut`, `post war`, `amoral Harry`, `astoria/harry`, `harem`
    - imagine someone who tries to take advantage of Harry after he's been lenient with them
    - then, instead of turning the other cheek, he then decides to takes advantage of them
    - then, instead of trying to stay away from Harry they come back for more
    - this is primarily smut, but it has actual character interactions and a semblance of plot
    - sure the characters are all OOC and smut reigns supreme, but the characters have agency and Milfoy is in the story often
